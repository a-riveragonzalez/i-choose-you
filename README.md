## How To Use
---
><b><i>I Choose You </b></i> is a free web application. To use the app, you first go to the link provided [here](https://ichooseyou.herokuapp.com/). Users (Trainers) must sign up or log in to an existing account. A new user will then take a personality quiz to determine what Pokemon type they are, showing what kind of traits they show depending on the answers they chose during the quiz. They can match with other Trainers and “battle” them – which means they can talk and get to know each other! Depending on how the battle goes, they can deepen their relationship.
